# recon-tool
Takes a list of urls (from httpx or wherever) and grabs screenshots, gets wappalyzer tech info, and does some semgrep like cursory matching for possible avenues to look in to.  After this it uses Jinja to create a html page of all of this info to browse through quickly during a large engeagement to determine where you want to spend your time.  Screenshots etc are stored in the project folder that you specify at command execution.
